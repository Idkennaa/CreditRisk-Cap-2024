# CreditRisk-Cap-2024
## Project Overview


In a flourishing economy, like Canada's, the maintainance of its credit system is quite important.  With the nation's residents accumulating credit worth over $2.3 trillion, nearly on par with its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at $2 trillion, it is evident that the economy is largely driven by a credit/loan infrastructure.

The problem then arises for banks and finalncial institutions tomaintain such credit system and one of the biggest problems weakening the system is the default rates of debtors. Analysing the probability a debtor may default on their payments is quite necessary to these institutions. This project aims to create a model/models that predict a customer defaulting on their payment based on certain factors.

The model created would be very beneficial to financial institutions such as **banks, credit unions, peer to peer lenders & numerous lending organisations**. The model is designed to minimize losses to these companies proving the accessibility to these funds. The model would also benefit such institutions through
- Enhanced Informed Decision making
- Fair Treatment of Creditworthy borrowers
- Investor Confidence and Security


## Subject Data

The data been used is sourrced from Nubank, A prominent brazilian digital bank and one of Latin America's biggest Fintech. The dataset sourced from this company was initially part of a competition created by the company on the topic of Credit Risk analysis. This dataset encompasses 43 features for 45,000 clients. Certain data fields, including customer ID, location (state & ZIP code), and Profile Tags, are hashed out to safeguard client privacy. The relevance of these data fields to the ML Model's training will be further assessed.


## Proposed Solution

There will be three primary machine-learning techniques that will be applied to this dataset to create a model for prediction. The deign is seen to be aclassification problem as opposed to a regression problem therefor classifciation machine learning techniques will be employed. These techniques are seen to be:

- Logistic Regression method
- K - Nearest Neighbor method
- Decision Trees method

- ### 1. Logistic Regression
The logistic Regression Model will be suitable for the design of this model as it handles classification precisely, especially a bi-result classification such as this. The main problems with a Logistic regression model would be 
1. **Its feature of creating only hard decision boundaries**, 
2. **Its insensitivity to outliers and**  
3. **Its difficulty with working with interdependent featutes as most of the features used in the dataset may be interdependent**.
Due to these boundaries, other models will also be taken into consideration


- ### 2. K - Nearest Neighbor Method
The K- Nearest Neighbor method is another technique that will be applied to this dataset. With the nature of this technique creating grounds for faster training, ease of implementation and irregular relationships between features( non - parametric feature felationships), it will be asuitabe method to create a model with. Few shortcomings of this tecnique, such as **handling of irrelevant features** and **lack of precision in handling Noisy Data**, will also lead to its pairing with another machine learning technique to select a suitable & efficient model


- ### 3. K - Deision Tree Method
