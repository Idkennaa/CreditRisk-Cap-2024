In a flourishing economy, like Canada's, the maintainance of its credit system is quite important.  With the nation's residents accumulating credit worth over $2.3 trillion, nearly on par with its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at $2 trillion, it is evident that the economy is largely driven by a credit/loan infrastructure.

The problem then arises for banks and finalncial institutions tomaintain such credit system and one of the biggest problems weakening the system is the default rates of debtors. Analysing the probability a debtor may default on their payments is quite necessary to these institutions. This project aims to create a model/models that predict a customer defaulting on their payment based on certain factors.

The model created would be very beneficial to financial institutions such as **banks, credit unions, peer to peer lenders & numerous lending organisations**. The model is designed to minimize losses to these companies proving the accessibility to these funds. The model would also benefit such institutions through
- Enhanced Informed Decision making
- Fair Treatment of Creditworthy borrowers
- Investor Confidence and Security


## Subject Data

The data been used is sourrced from Nubank, A prominent brazilian digital bank and one of Latin America's biggest Fintech. The dataset sourced from this company was initially part of a competition created by the company on the topic of Credit Risk analysis. This dataset encompasses 43 features for 45,000 clients. Certain data fields, including customer ID, location (state & ZIP code), and Profile Tags, are hashed out to safeguard client privacy. The relevance of these data fields to the ML Model's training will be further assessed.


## Proposed Solution

There will be three primary machine-learning techniques that will be applied to this dataset to create a model for prediction. These techniques are seen to be:

- Logistic Regression method
- K - Nearest Neighbor method
- Decision Trees method
